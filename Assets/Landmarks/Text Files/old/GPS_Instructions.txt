You are about to enter a virtual city, or a city that exists on the computer.  
Your job is to learn as much as you can about this city.  To simulate the experience of GPS-based navigation, 
arrows will appear showing you how to get to different places you need to find in the city.  
Follow the arrows to get to each of your destinations and try to get there as quickly as possible.  
We will then ask you questions about the locations of stores in the city.
 
Before you see the city, you will see images of some of the stores you are going to experience.
 
Good luck, and please try your best!
